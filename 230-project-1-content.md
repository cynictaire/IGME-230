## V. Esthetics

**Graphic style** 

* Cartoonish and also abstract

* Drum and bass heavy, different song for each stage

The game has sounds for scoring, combos, effect sound when player hits an enemy, UI, and background music depending on the stage.

## VI. Gameplay

**Mechanics**

* You must press the coresponding arrow key which represents each bandit as they run towards you. If you press the key before the bandit is
close or right in front of you, you will do half the damage you would usually do and receive less points if the bandit is close or in 
front of you. If you press the key as the bandit is in front of you, you will be doing full damage and will receive more points. If you did
not press the key in time, you will take the damage and your health bar will go down.

**Control**

* Arrow keys and spacebar on your keyboard

**New User Experience**

* A tutorial will be given to the player before they begin their first stage.

**Player Learning**

* In order to beat the game, the player must learn to hit the keys in time as the bandit arrives in front of them. If the player is 
able to hit the keys in time, they will build up combos, every 100 combos they reach, the amount of points they collect will double
for 5 seconds.
